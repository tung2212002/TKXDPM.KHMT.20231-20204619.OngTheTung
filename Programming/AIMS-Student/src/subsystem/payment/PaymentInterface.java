    /**
     * Module responsible for managing payment processing functionalities.
     *
     * Classes:
     * - PaymentProcessor: Interface defining methods for payment processing.
     * - PayPalPaymentProcessor: Implements PaymentProcessor for PayPal payments.
     * - CreditCardPaymentProcessor: Implements PaymentProcessor for credit card payments.
     *
     * Responsibilities:
     * - Encapsulates logic for processing different payment methods using specific processors.
     * - Provides a unified interface (PaymentProcessor) for handling various payment transactions.
     * - Promotes high cohesion by grouping payment-related functionalities together within this module.
     * - Each payment processor focuses on specific payment methods, maintaining a clear separation of concerns.
     *
     * Coupling:
     * - Low coupling is achieved by utilizing the PaymentProcessor interface, which acts as a contract
     *   for the system's payment processing. The system interacts with payment processors via this interface,
     *   allowing for easy integration of new payment methods without altering the core system logic.
     * - The system relies on the PaymentProcessor interface rather than concrete implementation classes, promoting
     *   loose coupling and enabling interchangeable usage of different payment processors.
     *
     * Note: This module achieves high cohesion by organizing payment processing functionality
     * into cohesive units (PaymentProcessor implementations) with each unit having a well-defined responsibility.
     * It promotes reusability by allowing addition of new payment processors without modifying existing logic,
     * ensuring a scalable and maintainable payment system.
